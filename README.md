## About the Site

This site is my personal home on the World Wide Intarnetzâ„¢. I write about stuff, I link to other stuff, and I showcase stuff I've done/built/designed. It's purely personal in nature and does not necessarily reflect the views of my wonderful employer, my Murica, my tattoo artist, my barber or my neighbor's dog. But it's where I represent, yo!

It lives here: [cnblog.club](http://cnblog.club)

For more about the latest iteration, read this blog post: [cnblog.club/writing/redesigning-and-rebuilding/](http://cnblog.club/writing/redesigning-and-rebuilding/)

Many of the post images are retouched versions of photos I found at [Unsplash](http://unsplash.com/). If you are looking for great photos to use on your own blog, they have a great collection all free for public use.
